# apt-tools

A set of python tools for importing, processing [and analysing] Atom Probe Tomography (APT) data.

Written for use with data produced by Cameca LEAP instruments, i.e. POS, ePOS and rrng files.

All scripts written by a working scientist, not a coder. They are a work in progress, and are provided 'as is'. That said, if you are having issues with them, or would like to see additional features, please get in touch or join as a contributor.


## Project Structure
- finished functions are kept in '.py' files at the top level.
- 'notebooks' contains a series of iPython Notebooks which contain all the functions in the '.py' files, and more (in development)
- 'example data' contains some example APT data (.pos, .epos and .rrng) to play with.
