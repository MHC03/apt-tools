# apt-tools

A set of python tools for importing, processing [and analysing] Atom Probe Tomography (APT) data.

Written for use with data produced by Cameca LEAP instruments, i.e. POS, ePOS and rrng files.

All scripts written by a working scientist, not a coder. They are a work in progress, and are provided 'as is'. That said, if you are having issues with them, or would like to see additional features, please get in touch.
